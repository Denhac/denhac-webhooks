     * some point in the future. New updates on the same device override the previous update.

     * The reason an int is allowed for expires is in the event we want to say "hold this door open for 5 seconds". If
     * that event takes 1 second to get to our Pi and the clocks are enough by 3 seconds, the door will only open for 1
     * second. This has the tradeoff that Carbon times like "close at 11:00 PM" might be a few seconds off.
